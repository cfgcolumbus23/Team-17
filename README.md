# CTRL-R

## What is CTRL-R?
CTRL-R is a mobile-responsive web application that is accessible to all devices! This project aims to help Pyramid CDC and their mission to provide IT and software education resources to everyone in Linden, but especially high schoolers.

## How does CTRL-R incentivize the pursuit of IT/software education
We know how much high schoolers love games, and a little competition is always fun! That is why we created a fun and engaging level and points system for our courses. For each course or certification you complete, you earn points. The more difficult/comprehensive the course, the more points you get. Those points can accumulate over time, and with enough points you can redeem them for gift cards, or for credits towards other higher level courses and certifications!

But those points aren't just for you... as you gain points, you increase in level. And those levels and points help place you on our monthly leaderboard! Our leaderboard functionality helps to provide a fun level of competition against one another, and in addition, those who top the leaderboards are rewarded!
